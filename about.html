            About this Tool
        </h1>

        <p>
            WC Vital is a tool that helps locate inclusive 
            spaces such as publicly available gender-neutral 
            bathrooms and free menstrual products in the local 
            Chapel Hill-Carrboro area. This tool allows a multitude 
            of different populations to gain access to a community 
            that will foster charity and inclusivity. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Menstrual products are taxed as luxury goods when they 
            should be treated as daily necessities so many populations 
            lack proper access to products. Period poverty is not a 
            novel issue and itâ€™s about time we come up with an 
            innovative solution to help underprivileged populations 
            have access to these basic products.

        <p>
            The users of the website can find locations 
            of places where they can find gender-neutral bathrooms 
            and free menstrual products. The locations of the menstrual 
            products would go both ways as people can donate and take products 
            based on their needs. This would provide a solid spot where people 
            can get products and leave them for others. And as for the bathrooms, 
            this tool would pinpoint the exact locations of gender-neutral 
            bathrooms in the area which is a convenient way to find these spaces 
            before-hand.

            Like Pearl Hacks, WC Vital strives to provide a supportive 
            environment where people from different socio-economic backgrounds 
            can come together and make a change for the larger population.
